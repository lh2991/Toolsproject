Project description:
  This project creates a website using Django based on
  2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv datafile.
  The data is imported into the website using management command import_squirrel_data.py.
  urls on this website includes 'sightings' for viewing all squirrels with buttons to all other functions.
  Other functions includes '<squirrel_id>/' for viewing and updating all squirrel attributes,
  'add' for adding new records to the existing database,
  'stats' for viewing statistics of the database and
  'map' for viewing all squirrel locations on a map (in the codes we plotted 250 but could be changed easily).
  The database can also be exported to local csvfile using the management Command
  export_squirrel_data. The exported data can also be reimported if necessary.
